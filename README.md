# Wallpaper-360
# 365 Days Progress – AMOLED Minimal Wallpaper

A minimal Python project that generates an AMOLED black wallpaper
with 365 dots — one for each day of the year.

Each day, one dot fills automatically based on the system date.

No reminders.
Just time moving forward.

---

## Why this project?

This project is about awareness, not pressure.

The dot fills whether you are productive or not.
That quiet truth is more powerful than any alarm.
